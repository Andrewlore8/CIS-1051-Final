# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Today's Top 10 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that sends you an email every morning informing you of the top 10 highest and lowest stock options. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will import data from libraries to gather the historical data of various stocks. I am then going to create a folder using a while loop. Upon finding the on balance value it will then sort the stocks into a CSV based upon their on balance value. So far I have used a lot of loops specificially in this section. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome is that the code prints out the top 10 highest and lowest stock options.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I would like to be able to incorporate a way to filter which stocks I am analyzing. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best outcome is I have it send out the email. This has been giving me the most trouble so far. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Some skills I need to acquire are I need to learn what functions to use when trying to send out the email. I need to do more reaserch on how to find  each stocks cumlative volume.  I also need to do more research on if I have the nessary libraries to take the stock information from.
